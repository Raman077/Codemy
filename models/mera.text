Good evening, I am Raman, a fourth year undergrad student from IIIT Gwalior, currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology. 

As a child I have been a problem solver. I loved solving maths and physics numericals. And in college, understandably, I have mostly been a competitive programmer for most of my college years. Then I switched to ML, Backend to gain something extra from my college years. i also have deep interest in network security. Presently I am preparing for GATE. I have a lot of experience with team projects. I have been the focal point of all my teams and have also worked as the force of cohesion and motivation to my team members.

and my extra curriculars- love to sing, cricket, karate. 

inspiration - dhoni

person i want to become - presently a jack of all trades.
